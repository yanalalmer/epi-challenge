option 1: is a re-creation of design-1 with the cats images, you can rate your quote based on one of 3 options, once you choose your rating the card will move to the next slide and the rating will be re-set

option 2: based on design-2 with the star-rating but this time you can edit your choice and change the rating at any given moment, I have also added arrows to switch between slides and reset the rating (I have also added a cute comment that shows up once a rating is selected)

option 3: again based on design-1 but this time you can select multiple ratings at the same time, so rating wont reset until you moved to the next slide.
